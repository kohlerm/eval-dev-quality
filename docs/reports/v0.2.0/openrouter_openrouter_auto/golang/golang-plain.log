2024/04/03 23:04:08 Model "openrouter/openrouter/auto" responded to query       Given the following Go code file "plain.go" with package "plain", provide a test file for this code.
        The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
        The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

        ```golang
        package plain

        func plain() {
                return // This does not do anything but it gives us a line to cover.
        }
        ```
 with:  ```golang
        package plain_test

        import (
                "testing"

                "plain"
        )

        func TestPlain(t *testing.T) {
                plain.Plain() // Calling plain to achieve 100% coverage. No assertions needed as function does not do anything.
        }
        ```
