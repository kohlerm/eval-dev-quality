2024/04/03 23:04:02 Model "openrouter/openchat/openchat-7b" responded to query  Given the following Go code file "plain.go" with package "plain", provide a test file for this code.
        The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
        The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

        ```golang
        package plain

        func plain() {
                return // This does not do anything but it gives us a line to cover.
        }
        ```
 with:   ```golang
        package test_plain

        import (
                "testing"
                "plain"
        )

        func Test_plain(t *testing.T) {
                for i := 0; i < 10000; i++ {
                        _ = plain.plain()
                }
        }
