2024/04/03 23:00:35 Model "openrouter/mistralai/mistral-tiny" responded to query        Given the following Go code file "plain.go" with package "plain", provide a test file for this code.
        The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
        The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

        ```golang
        package plain

        func plain() {
                return // This does not do anything but it gives us a line to cover.
        }
        ```
 with:  Here's a simple test file "plain_test.go" for the given "plain.go" code:

        ```go
        package plain

        import "testing"

        func TestPlain(t *testing.T) {
                // Ensure that running the function does not result in an error.
                plain()
        }

        func BenchmarkPlain(b *testing.B) {
                // Benchmark the function to ensure it's being executed.
                for i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {
                        plain()
                }
        }
        ```

        Please note that this test file might not reach 100% code coverage, as the plain function is empty. To reach 100% coverage, you would need to add some functionality to the plain function and test its various branches. This minimal test file is intended to only compile and run without errors.
