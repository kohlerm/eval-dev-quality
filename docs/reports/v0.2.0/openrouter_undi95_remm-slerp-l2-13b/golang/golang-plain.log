2024/04/03 23:06:55 Model "openrouter/undi95/remm-slerp-l2-13b" responded to query      Given the following Go code file "plain.go" with package "plain", provide a test file for this code.
        The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
        The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

        ```golang
        package plain

        func plain() {
                return // This does not do anything but it gives us a line to cover.
        }
        ```
 with:   >> _ is part of the golang.org/x/net/html package
        ```golang
        package plain

        import (
                "fmt"
                "math/rand"
                "testing"
        )

        func TestPlain(t *testing.T) {
                for i := 0; i < 100; i++ {
                        plain()

                fmt.Println("100% code coverage achieved!")
