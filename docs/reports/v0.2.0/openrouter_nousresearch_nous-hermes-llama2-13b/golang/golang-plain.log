2024/04/03 23:03:03 Model "openrouter/nousresearch/nous-hermes-llama2-13b" responded to query   Given the following Go code file "plain.go" with package "plain", provide a test file for this code.
        The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
        The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

        ```golang
        package plain

        func plain() {
                return // This does not do anything but it gives us a line to cover.
        }
        ```
 with:   Here is the test file for the given Go code:

        ```golang
        package plain_test

        import (
                "fmt"
                "testing"

                "github.com/stretchr/testify/assert"
        )

        func TestPlain(t *testing.T) {
                assert.NotPanics(t, func() { plain(); })
        }
        ```

        This test file tests the "plain" function in the "plain" package. The "plain" function does not have any output or input parameters, so it is easy to write a test case to ensure it does not cause any panic. The test file uses the "assert" package from "github.com/stretchr/testify/assert" to assert that the function does not cause any panic.
