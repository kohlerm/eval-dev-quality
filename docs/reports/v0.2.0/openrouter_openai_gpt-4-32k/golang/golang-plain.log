        The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
        The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

        ```golang
        package plain

        func plain() {
                return // This does not do anything but it gives us a line to cover.
        }
        ```

        package plain

        import (
                "plain"

        )

        func TestPlain(t *testing.T) {
                plain.plain()
        }
        ```
