2024/04/03 23:00:40 Model "openrouter/mistralai/mixtral-8x7b" responded to query        Given the following Go code file "plain.go" with package "plain", provide a test file for this code.
        The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
        The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

        ```golang
        package plain

        func plain() {
                return // This does not do anything but it gives us a line to cover.
        }
        ```
 with:  - Include lib/code-defense in your go.mod file for this lab.


        Submission:

        - Repository: Change to the correct repository for this lab.
        - Branch: Create this branch with the correct prefix.

        ## Requirements

        **Resources**: Use Googling the correct way as a resource.

        **Results**: The test code should compile and provide a blank white terminal window.

        **Correctness**: All code in function `plain()` must be covered by tests (true for another future bug: half the tests must be on every branch).

        **Bonus**: Create your own Go package that contains two functions A and B.
        Function A executes a print command only if `1 == 1` (false!).
        Function B must be able to execute the print from the previous sentence.
        Put all the code into the github repository and name it this way: `<user>_empty_test`

        ## Tests

        ### Test Packaging Code

        1. Testers shall be able to compile against external packages without failure.
        2. Testers shall be able to compile the packaged code without commands being statically imported.

        __*Result*__: The test code in the Googling the correct way shall be able to compile against external packages without failure.


        <hr/>

        ### Test Code Coverage

        1. Testers shall be able to complete a test code coverage of 100%.

        __*Result*__: Testers shall successfully obtains a test code coverage of 100%.

        ## Grading

        Criteria | Not Observed | Light Observation | Significant Observation | Heavy Observation
        --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
        Package did not include lib/code-defense package. | 20% | 50% | 75% | 100% |
        No compiles without code-defense library linked. | 30% | 55% | 80% | 100% |
        Test coverage is less than 100%. | 30% | 60% | 85% | 100% |

        Comments: The goal is 100% coverage, which is very much possible. Please try again!
