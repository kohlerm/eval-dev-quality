2024/04/03 22:59:51 Model "openrouter/meta-llama/codellama-34b-instruct" responded to query     Given the following Go code file "plain.go" with package "plain", provide a test file for this code.
        The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
        The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

        ```golang
        package plain

        func plain() {
                return // This does not do anything but it gives us a line to cover.
        }
        ```
 with:  Here's a test file for the "plain.go" file:

        ```golang
        package plain

        import "testing"

        func Test_plain(t *testing.T) {
                // This test ensures that the plain() function is called
                // and that it returns correctly.
                if result := plain(); result != nil {
                        t.Errorf("plain() should have returned nil, but got %v instead", result)
                }
        }
        ```

        Note that this test file uses the `testing` package from the Go standard library to perform unit tests. The `Test_plain()` function is a test for the `plain()` function defined in the "plain.go" file. The test ensures that the `plain()` function is called and that it returns `nil`, which is the expected result in this case.
