2024/04/03 22:53:04 Model "openrouter/anthropic/claude-2.1:beta" responded to query     Given the following Go code file "plain.go" with package "plain", provide a test file for this code.
        The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
        The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

        ```golang
        package plain

        func plain() {
                return // This does not do anything but it gives us a line to cover.
        }
        ```
 with:   Here is the test file to achieve 100% code coverage for the plain.go file:

        ```go
        package plain

        import "testing"

        func TestPlain(t *testing.T) {
            plain()
        }
        ```

        This test file imports the "testing" package, declares a TestPlain function as required by the testing package, calls the plain() function from the plain package, and has no other contents. Running `go test` on this will execute the test, cover the one line in plain.go, and produce 100% coverage.
