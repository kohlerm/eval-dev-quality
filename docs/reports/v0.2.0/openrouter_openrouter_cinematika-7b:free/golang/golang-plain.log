2024/04/03 23:04:12 Model "openrouter/openrouter/cinematika-7b:free" responded to query         Given the following Go code file "plain.go" with package "plain", provide a test file for this code.
        The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
        The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

        ```golang
        package plain

        func plain() {
                return // This does not do anything but it gives us a line to cover.
        }
        ```
 with:  Sure, here's a test file for the plain.go code file:

        ```golang
        package plain_test

        import (
                "testing"
        )

        func TestPlain(t *testing.T) {
                // This test ensures that the plain function is covered.
                plain()
        }
        ```
