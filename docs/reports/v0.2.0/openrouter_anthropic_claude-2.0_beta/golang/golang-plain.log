        The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

        ```golang
        package plain

        func plain() {
                return // This does not do anything but it gives us a line to cover.
        }
        ```

        package plain_test

        import "testing"

        func TestPlain(t *testing.T) {

        }
        ```
