2024/04/03 22:54:12 Model "openrouter/google/gemma-7b-it" responded to query    Given the following Go code file "plain.go" with package "plain", provide a test file for this code.
        The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
        The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

        ```golang
        package plain

        func plain() {
                return // This does not do anything but it gives us a line to cover.
        }
        ```
 with:  ```go
        package plain

        import "testing"

        func TestPlain(t *testing.T) {
                t.Run("Function returns nothing", func(t *testing.T) {
                        plain()
                        t.Log("Function returned successfully")
                })
        }
        ```
