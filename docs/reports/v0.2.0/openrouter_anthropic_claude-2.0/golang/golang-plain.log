2024/04/03 22:52:48 Model "openrouter/anthropic/claude-2.0" responded to query  Given the following Go code file "plain.go" with package "plain", provide a test file for this code.
        The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
        The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

        ```golang
        package plain

        func plain() {
                return // This does not do anything but it gives us a line to cover.
        }
        ```
 with:   Here is the test file to achieve 100% code coverage for plain.go:

        ```go
        package plain

        import "testing"

        func TestPlain(t *testing.T) {
            plain()
        }
        ```

        This tests calls the plain() function which covers the only line in plain.go. Calling plain() directly from the test function covers the plain() function definition and the return statement inside it. This achieves 100% code coverage.
