2024/04/03 23:00:45 Model "openrouter/mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct:nitro" responded to query         Given the following Go code file "plain.go" with package "plain", provide a test file for this code.
        The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
        The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

        ```golang
        package plain

        func plain() {
                return // This does not do anything but it gives us a line to cover.
        }
        ```
 with:  ```golang
        package plain

        import "testing"

        func TestPlain(t *testing.T) {
                // A simple test that checks if the function returns.
                plain()
        }

        // The following coverage test will ensure that the function is tested.
        func TestCoverage(t *testing.T) {
                cov := 0
                if plain() {
                        cov++
                }
                if cov != 1 {
                        t.Fatalf("Failed to cover line: cov=%d", cov)
                }
        }
        ```
