2024/04/03 23:02:30 Model "openrouter/nousresearch/nous-hermes-2-mistral-7b-dpo" responded to query     Given the following Go code file "plain.go" with package "plain", provide a test file for this code.
        The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
        The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

        ```golang
        package plain

        func plain() {
                return // This does not do anything but it gives us a line to cover.
        }
        ```
 with:  ```golang
        package test

        import (
                "fmt"
                "plain"
                "testing"
        )

        func TestPlainFunction(t *testing.T) {
                for i := 0; i < 5; i++ { // Test 5 times to ensure 100% coverage
                        plain()
                }
        }
        ```
