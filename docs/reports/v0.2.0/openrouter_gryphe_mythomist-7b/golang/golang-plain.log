2024/04/03 22:55:07 Model "openrouter/gryphe/mythomist-7b" responded to query   Given the following Go code file "plain.go" with package "plain", provide a test file for this code.
        The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
        The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

        ```golang
        package plain

        func plain() {
                return // This does not do anything but it gives us a line to cover.
        }
        ```
 with:  package testing

        import (
                "testing"
                "github.com/testing-readonly-public-address/plain"
        )

        func TestPlainFunction(t *testing.T) {
                for i := 0; i < 100; i++ {
                        plain.plain()
                }

                if len(plain.GlobalList) > 0 {
                        t.Errorf("list should be empty, but it contains: %v", plain.GlobalList)
                }
