2024/04/03 23:06:50 Model "openrouter/togethercomputer/stripedhyena-hessian-7b" responded to query      Given the following Go code file "plain.go" with package "plain", provide a test file for this code.
        The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
        The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

        ```golang
        package plain

        func plain() {
                return // This does not do anything but it gives us a line to cover.
        }
        ```
 with:  Expected response

        ```golang
        package testing

        import (
                "testing"

                "testing"

                "testing"
        )

        func TestMain(m *testing.M) {
                os.Exit(m.Run())
        }

        func Test_printMatch(t *testing.T) {
                if plain() == "test" {
                        t.Errorf("Result did not match!")
                }
        }
