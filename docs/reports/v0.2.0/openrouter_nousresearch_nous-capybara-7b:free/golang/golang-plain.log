2024/04/03 23:02:29 Model "openrouter/nousresearch/nous-capybara-7b:free" responded to query    Given the following Go code file "plain.go" with package "plain", provide a test file for this code.
        The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
        The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

        ```golang
        package plain

        func plain() {
                return // This does not do anything but it gives us a line to cover.
        }
        ```
 with:   ```go
        package main

        import (
                "testing"
                "plain"
        )

        func TestPlain(t *testing.T) {
                broken := 0
                covered := 0
                lines := []struct {
                        line     int
                        covered  bool
                        broken   bool
                }{
                        {1, false, false},
                        {2, true, false},
                }

                for _, line := range lines {
                        if line.covered {
                                covered++
                        } else if line.broken {
                                broken++
                        }
                }

                if broken > 0 || covered != 2 {
                        t.Errorf("broken=%d, covered=%d\n", broken, covered)
                }
        }
        ```
