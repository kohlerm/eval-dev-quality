        The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
        The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

        ```golang
        package plain

        func plain() {
                return // This does not do anything but it gives us a line to cover.
        }
        ```
 with:  To achieve 100 percent code coverage and instantiate the "plain" package implementation, please refer to the previous instruction in this conversation.
