2024/04/03 23:02:19 Model "openrouter/nousresearch/nous-capybara-34b" responded to query        Given the following Go code file "plain.go" with package "plain", provide a test file for this code.
        The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
        The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

        ```golang
        package plain

        func plain() {
                return // This does not do anything but it gives us a line to cover.
        }
        ```
 with:   ```go
        package plain

        import (
                "testing"
        )

        func TestPlain(t *testing.T) {
                if plain() != nil {
                        t.Errorf("plain() should return nothing, got %v", plain())
                }
        }
        ```
