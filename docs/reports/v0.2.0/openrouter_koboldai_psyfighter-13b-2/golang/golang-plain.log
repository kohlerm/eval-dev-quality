2024/04/03 22:59:19 Model "openrouter/koboldai/psyfighter-13b-2" responded to query     Given the following Go code file "plain.go" with package "plain", provide a test file for this code.
        The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
        The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

        ```golang
        package plain

        func plain() {
                return // This does not do anything but it gives us a line to cover.
        }
        ```
 with:  Test file: test_plain.go
        ```go
        package plain

        import (
                "fmt"
                "io/ioutil"
        )

        func TestPlain(t *testing.T) {
                tests := []struct {
                        name    string
                        args    []string
                        wantout string
                }{
                        {
                                name:    "No arguments, return everything with default value of function",
                                args:    []string{},
                                wantout: `plain returns nothing and does nothing.

        Good job on writing useless but necessary tests though.
