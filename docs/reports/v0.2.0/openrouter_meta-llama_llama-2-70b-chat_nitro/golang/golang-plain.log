2024/04/03 23:00:00 Model "openrouter/meta-llama/llama-2-70b-chat:nitro" responded to query     Given the following Go code file "plain.go" with package "plain", provide a test file for this code.
        The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
        The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

        ```golang
        package plain

        func plain() {
                return // This does not do anything but it gives us a line to cover.
        }
        ```
 with:    Sure, here's a test file for the "plain" package:

        ```golang
        package plain

        import "testing"

        func TestPlain(t *testing.T) {
                plain()
        }
        ```

        This test file imports the "testing" package and defines a single test function, `TestPlain`. The `TestPlain` function calls the `plain` function, which does nothing but provides a line to cover. Running this test will result in 100% code coverage for the `plain` function.
