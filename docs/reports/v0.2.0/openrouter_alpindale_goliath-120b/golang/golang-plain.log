2024/04/03 22:52:32 Model "openrouter/alpindale/goliath-120b" responded to query        Given the following Go code file "plain.go" with package "plain", provide a test file for this code.
        The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
        The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

        ```golang
        package plain

        func plain() {
                return // This does not do anything but it gives us a line to cover.
        }
        ```
 with:   Here is the test file "plain_test.go" for the given code:
        ```go
        package plain


        import (
                "fmt"
                "testing"
        )

        func TestPlain(t *testing.T) {
                 // Test that plain does not panic
                defer func() {
                        if x := recover(); x != nil {
                                t.Errorf("plain() panics: %v", x)
                        }
                }()
                plain()
                // this line is needed to make test coverage 100%
                fmt.Println("TestPlain: all good")
        }
        ```
        To run the tests, add the following in a file named "plain_test.go":
        ```go
        package main


        import (
                "path/filepath"
                "testing"
        )

        func TestMain(m *testing.M) {
                err := testing.Main(m,
                        // Set the seed to a deterministic value for reproducible coverage.
                        // Comment out the -coverprofile and -covermode=atomic flags
                        // to see the difference.
                        // Uncomment -v to see the tests running.
                        "-race", "-v",
                        // Coverage report
                        // "--test.cover mehrerer=100 -coverprofile=cover.out -covermode=atomic",
                        // Find the test files in this package folder
                        "-test.f 1="+filepath.Base(filepath.Dir(filepath.SplitList(os.Args)[1]),
                                "-vet=short",
                                "-cover",
                                // Continue to run the tests after the first failure
