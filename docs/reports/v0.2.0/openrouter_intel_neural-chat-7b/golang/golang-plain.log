2024/04/03 22:57:49 Model "openrouter/intel/neural-chat-7b" responded to query  Given the following Go code file "plain.go" with package "plain", provide a test file for this code.
        The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
        The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

        ```golang
        package plain

        func plain() {
                return // This does not do anything but it gives us a line to cover.
        }
        ```

        import (
                "fmt"

                // Testing to cover all lines of plain() function
                plain()
                // To cover the function, but not the return type specifically
                fakePlain := func() {}
                fakePlain()
                if testing.VerbatimCompare(plain, fakePlain) == false {
                        t.Error("Failed to cover, but both functions did nothing different.")
                }
                // Testing to make sure the code compiled successfully without introducing errors
                // Run the tests as well and ensure we get 100% code coverage.
                // Include further tests if required for specific functions and end with a Failing and passing tests. Keep it short and simple.
        }
