2024/04/03 23:00:53 Model "openrouter/neversleep/noromaid-20b" responded to query       Given the following Go code file "plain.go" with package "plain", provide a test file for this code.
        The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
        The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

        ```golang
        package plain

        func plain() {
                return // This does not do anything but it gives us a line to cover.
        }
        ```
 with:  package tests

        import "testing"

        import (
                "fmt"
                "github.com/sturim/require/require"
        )

        func TestPlain(t *testing.T) {
                t.Run("main func should run", func(t *testing.T) {
            plain()
            require.NoErrorf(t, nil, "main should not return an error")
        })

        ```
