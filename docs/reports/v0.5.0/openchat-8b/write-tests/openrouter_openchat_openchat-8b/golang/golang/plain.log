2024/06/19 11:15:09 Evaluating model "openrouter/openchat/openchat-8b" on task "write-tests" using language "golang" and repository "golang/plain"
2024/06/19 11:15:09 Querying model "openrouter/openchat/openchat-8b" with:
	Given the following Go code file "plain.go" with package "plain", provide a test file for this code.
	The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
	The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

	```golang
	package plain

	func plain() {
		return // This does not do anything but it gives us a line to cover.
	}
	```
2024/06/19 11:15:10 Model "openrouter/openchat/openchat-8b" responded (1762 ms) with:
	Here is a test file for the given Go code file "plain.go":
	```golang
	package plain

	import (
		"testing"
	)

	func TestPlain(t *testing.T) {
		plain()
		result := plain()
		expected := "" // Replace with the expected result if the function has a return value

		if result!= expected {
			t.Errorf("Expected %v, got %v", expected, result)
		}
	}
	```
	This test file imports the "testing" package and defines a function `TestPlain` that calls the `plain()` function and compares the result with the expected result. If the result does not match the expected result, the test will fail and print an error message.
