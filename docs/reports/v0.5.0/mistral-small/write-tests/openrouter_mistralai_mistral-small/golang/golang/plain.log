	This test file contains a single test function `TestPlain` which calls the `plain` function. Since there's only one line of code in the `plain` function, calling it will result in 100% code coverage. The test file compiles without errors and can be run using `go test -cover`.

	Here is a test file for your code that should achieve 100% coverage:

	```golang
	package plain

	import (
		"testing"
	)

	func TestPlain(t *testing.T) {

	This test file imports the `testing` package and defines a single test function `TestPlain`. The test function simply calls the `plain` function, which will cover the only line of code in your `plain.go` file.
