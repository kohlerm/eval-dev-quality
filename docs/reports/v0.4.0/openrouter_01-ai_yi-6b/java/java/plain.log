2024/04/25 14:08:16 Evaluating model "openrouter/01-ai/yi-6b" using language "java" and repository "java/plain"
2024/04/25 14:08:16 Querying model "openrouter/01-ai/yi-6b" with:
	Given the following Java code file "src/main/java/com/eval/Plain.java" with package "com.eval", provide a test file for this code with JUnit 5 as a test framework.
	The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
	The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

	```java
	package com.eval;

	class Plain {
	    static void plain() {
	    }
	}
	```
2024/04/25 14:08:29 Model "openrouter/01-ai/yi-6b" responded with:
	- Write a code for the class [Plain](https://github.com/sgjesse/PatternRecognitionAssignment/blob/main/src/main/java/com/eval/Plain.java). Use an abstract class for Plain and supply a JUnit test to ensure 100% code coverage

	concrete)

	```java
	package com.eval;

	class PlainImpl extends Plain {
	    static void plain(int n) {
	        System.out.println("Implemented!");
	    }
	}
	```

	- Write a code for the [Unit test](https://github.com/sgjesse/PatternRecognitionAssignment/blob/main/src/test/java/com/eval/PlainTest.java) test file and test the method [plain](https://github.com/sgjesse/PatternRecognitionAssignment/blob/main/src/main/java/com/eval/Plain.java#L5) of the class [Plain](https://github.com/sgjesse/PatternRecognitionAssignment/blob/main/src/main/java/com/eval/Plain.java). Ensure 100% code coverage.

	**Recommended Tips:**

	* indent code correctly with appropriate spaces.
	* add unit tests for all classes compiled, even if you cannot test all methods
	* explain all JUnit test code in the code body and the test class test description
	* use inheritance in sub cases and child cases to avoid repeated tests
	* use constants for readable constant values to avoid Indian exports. like: for constant values of ONE_EGG_PRICE, TWO_EGG_PRICE, THREE_EGG_PRICE, use lowercase.
	* test only code that needs to be tested
	* use a method in subcases instead of writing JUnit test code in the main test class
	* add unit tests before classes, not after
	* when copying code statements from the code of the class to be tested to the test code, they must be edited to better understand what is happening in the test
	* add unit test code after the class code, not before
	* for a fully written unit test with its own curly brackets, test classes use the testDiscoveryPackage name "com.object.group", not "com.object"
	* put unit tests in separate test classes for reusable test units
	* test methods with parameters always in subclasses, never in the main test class

	**Warning: Past students have fallen for this trap:**

	> Sometimes students tried to write the class stub code in the main test class because their JUnit test classes are in a sub-folder of the class package name. If the main test class is in the folder with the test classes, then the JUnit test classes cannot be found which is why no code can be executed

	- Note:

	  If you are new to JUnit5 and want to learn how to write an Junit5 test for this class, please [check the following CodingWorld tutorials](https://codingworld.app/news/198-automatisches-deutschland/) for more information.

	> We simply tested UI elements with all three statements and then built workflows to solve daily activities.

	**Describe what you command:**

	- first export as a class
	- then implement unit tests for the methods
	- then provide your finished holidays in the submission in Facebook transparent folder

	**Describe what test you made:**

	Explain what you did (what you explained, how you solved influences your score) and which parameters you used when creating an assertion

	**Describe what to do:**

	Tell your solution if there is a doubt whether your solution is correct or not

	- for test 2 we do nothing
	- for test 3 everything, everything like with tea, bread and chocolate
	  - cowboy, Sainy, Jimmy, disqualification ...

	**Tips for Apache Ant:**

	```ant
	<!-- Quick start "tester.bat"
	run this line Local build with Visual Studio.

	<echo message="path "><property name="path" value="G:\B\trunk\projects\workbench\setup\1_welcome\1_workbench\vardir\NodePackages" assertion="true" />
	<property name="workspace" value="${path}" />
	<ant -file "${workspace}\ApacheAnt\build.xml" />

	-->

	<project basedir="." default="build" name="setFile comparison testProject">

	```
	## Polymorphism java:

	On a timeout in the virtual timeout window the underlying event object must be expanded in context mode so that it is no longer its base implementation but a more concrete implementing class. An interface/{M,MP}placeUnderObjTimedEventTask<C> is needed to be distinguished from an interface/{M,MP}placeUnderObject(C) Timed event task with the polymorphism mechanism.

	## Creating your own parameterized tests for Junit Cases:
