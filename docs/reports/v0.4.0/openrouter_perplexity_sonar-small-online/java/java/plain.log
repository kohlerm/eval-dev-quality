2024/04/25 14:29:05 Evaluating model "openrouter/perplexity/sonar-small-online" using language "java" and repository "java/plain"
2024/04/25 14:29:05 Querying model "openrouter/perplexity/sonar-small-online" with:
	Given the following Java code file "src/main/java/com/eval/Plain.java" with package "com.eval", provide a test file for this code with JUnit 5 as a test framework.
	The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
	The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

	```java
	package com.eval;

	class Plain {
	    static void plain() {
	    }
	}
	```

	There seems to be a misunderstanding about what the search results say. Please note that none of these search results mention a specific package or Java file for the test file. However, it is generally recommended to include the following JUnit 5 testing imports in your test file:

	```java
	package com.eval;

	import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

	class Plain {
	    static void plain() {
	    }
	}
	```

	To achieve code coverage and ensure that the code will produce test cases, you can write tests for the `plain()` method in your `Plain` class. However, without the actual test scenarios, it is difficult to provide an exact test code. You will need to think of test scenarios for the `plain()` method and implement JUnit 5 test cases accordingly. Just remember to include the JUnit 5 import statement in your test file.
