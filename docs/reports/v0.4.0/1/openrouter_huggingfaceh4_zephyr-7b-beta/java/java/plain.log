2024/04/25 14:14:03 Evaluating model "openrouter/huggingfaceh4/zephyr-7b-beta" using language "java" and repository "java/plain"
2024/04/25 14:14:03 Querying model "openrouter/huggingfaceh4/zephyr-7b-beta" with:
	Given the following Java code file "src/main/java/com/eval/Plain.java" with package "com.eval", provide a test file for this code with JUnit 5 as a test framework.
	The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
	The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

	```java
	package com.eval;

	class Plain {
	    static void plain() {
	    }
	}
	```

	To achieve 100% code coverage using JUnit 5 with this Java code file, you can write test methods for the `plain()` method in the `Plain` class. Here's an example test file:
	```java
	package com.eval;

	import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
	import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;

	public class PlainTest {

	    @Test
	    public void testPlainMethod() {
	        Plain plain = new Plain();
	        plain.plain(); // Call the plain() method itself
	        assertEquals(true, true); // Assert that true is true
	    }

	}
	```
	This test file imports the `Assertions` class from `org.junit.jupiter.api` to provide assertion methods for checking if the code runs correctly. It creates an instance of the `Plain` class, calls the `plain()` method, and then performs an assertion using the `assertEquals()` method to make sure `true` is true.

	Once you run this test file in an IDE or using `mvn test` or `gradle test`, it will produce code coverage reports indicating which parts of the `Plain` class were executed during the test.
