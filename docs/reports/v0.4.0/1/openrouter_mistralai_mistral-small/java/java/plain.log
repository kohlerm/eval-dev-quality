2024/04/25 14:20:46 Evaluating model "openrouter/mistralai/mistral-small" using language "java" and repository "java/plain"
2024/04/25 14:20:46 Querying model "openrouter/mistralai/mistral-small" with:
	Given the following Java code file "src/main/java/com/eval/Plain.java" with package "com.eval", provide a test file for this code with JUnit 5 as a test framework.
	The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
	The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

	```java
	package com.eval;

	class Plain {
	    static void plain() {
	    }
	}
	```
2024/04/25 14:20:50 Model "openrouter/mistralai/mistral-small" responded with:
	Here is the JUnit 5 test file for the provided Java code:

	```java
	package com.eval;

	import org.junit.jupiter.api.DisplayName;
	import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
	import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertTrue;

	public class PlainTest {

	    @Test
	    @DisplayName("Test empty method")
	    public void testPlain() {
	        Plain.plain();
	        assertTrue(true);
	    }
	}
	```

	This test file covers the `plain` method of the `Plain` class with 100% code coverage. The test just calls the `plain` method and checks that the outcome is as expected (which is always true).

	Note: The coverage report may indicate that there is no coverage on the `static void plain()` since it is empty. The suggested test case will suffice for JUnit to compile, run, and provide code coverage reports.
