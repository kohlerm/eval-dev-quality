2024/04/25 14:01:51 Evaluating model "openrouter/meta-llama/codellama-34b-instruct" using language "golang" and repository "golang/plain"
2024/04/25 14:01:51 Querying model "openrouter/meta-llama/codellama-34b-instruct" with:
	Given the following Go code file "plain.go" with package "plain", provide a test file for this code.
	The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
	The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

	```golang
	package plain

	func plain() {
		return // This does not do anything but it gives us a line to cover.
	}
	```
2024/04/25 14:01:54 Model "openrouter/meta-llama/codellama-34b-instruct" responded with:
	Give this test file a name like "plain_test.go":

	```go
	package plain

	import "testing"

	func TestPlain(t *testing.T) {
		plain()
	}
	```
	This code will produce 100 percent code coverage since all the lines in the "plain() function" are executed in the "TestPlain() function".
