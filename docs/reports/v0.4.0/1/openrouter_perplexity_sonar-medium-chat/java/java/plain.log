2024/04/25 14:28:36 Evaluating model "openrouter/perplexity/sonar-medium-chat" using language "java" and repository "java/plain"
2024/04/25 14:28:36 Querying model "openrouter/perplexity/sonar-medium-chat" with:
	Given the following Java code file "src/main/java/com/eval/Plain.java" with package "com.eval", provide a test file for this code with JUnit 5 as a test framework.
	The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
	The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

	```java
	package com.eval;

	class Plain {
	    static void plain() {
	    }
	}
	```
2024/04/25 14:28:41 Model "openrouter/perplexity/sonar-medium-chat" responded with:
	Here's a JUnit 5 test file that should achieve 100% code coverage for the given `Plain` class:

	```java
	package com.eval;

	import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;
	import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

	class PlainTest {

	    @Test
	    void testPlain() {
	        Plain.plain();
	        // Add any necessary assertions here to ensure the method is working as expected
	    }
	}
	```

	This test file includes a single test method, `testPlain()`, that calls the `plain()` method in the `Plain` class. Since there are no assertions or logic in the `plain()` method, this test method is sufficient to achieve 100% code coverage. However, if there is any expected behavior for the `plain()` method, you should add appropriate assertions to the `testPlain()` method to ensure that the method is working as expected.
