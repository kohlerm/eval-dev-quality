2024/04/25 18:27:23 Evaluating model "openrouter/mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct" using language "golang" and repository "golang/plain"
2024/04/25 18:27:23 Querying model "openrouter/mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct" with:
	Given the following Go code file "plain.go" with package "plain", provide a test file for this code.
	The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
	The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

	```golang
	package plain

	func plain() {
		return // This does not do anything but it gives us a line to cover.
	}
	```
2024/04/25 18:27:29 Model "openrouter/mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct" responded with:
	 Here is a test file that should produce 100% code coverage for the given `plain.go` file:
	```
	package plain

	import (
		"testing"
	)

	func TestPlain(t *testing.T) {
		// Call the function under test.
		plain()

		// Check that the function returns correctly (even though
		// it doesn't do anything, it's still good practice to include
		// some kind of check).
		if true != true {
			t.Errorf("plain() did not return correctly.")
		}
	}
	```
	This test function calls the `plain` function and checks that it returns correctly. This should be sufficient to produce 100% code coverage for the `plain.go` file.
