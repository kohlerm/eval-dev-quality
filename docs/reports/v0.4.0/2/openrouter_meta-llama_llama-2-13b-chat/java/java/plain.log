2024/04/25 18:41:42 Evaluating model "openrouter/meta-llama/llama-2-13b-chat" using language "java" and repository "java/plain"
2024/04/25 18:41:42 Querying model "openrouter/meta-llama/llama-2-13b-chat" with:
	Given the following Java code file "src/main/java/com/eval/Plain.java" with package "com.eval", provide a test file for this code with JUnit 5 as a test framework.
	The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
	The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

	```java
	package com.eval;

	class Plain {
	    static void plain() {
	    }
	}
	```
2024/04/25 18:41:45 Model "openrouter/meta-llama/llama-2-13b-chat" responded with:
	Here's the test file for the provided Java code:
	```java
	package com.eval;

	import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

	class PlainTest {
	    @Test
	    void plain() {
	        Plain.plain();
	    }
	}
	```
	This test file tests the `plain()` method of the `Plain` class with a single test method. The test method has no arguments and simply calls the `plain()` method.

	With this test file, you should be able to achieve 100% code coverage for the `Plain` class.
