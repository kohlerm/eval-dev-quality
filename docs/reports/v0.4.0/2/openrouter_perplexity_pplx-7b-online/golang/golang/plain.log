2024/04/25 18:29:56 Evaluating model "openrouter/perplexity/pplx-7b-online" using language "golang" and repository "golang/plain"
2024/04/25 18:29:56 Querying model "openrouter/perplexity/pplx-7b-online" with:
	Given the following Go code file "plain.go" with package "plain", provide a test file for this code.
	The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
	The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

	```golang
	package plain

	func plain() {
		return // This does not do anything but it gives us a line to cover.
	}
	```

	To create a test file for the "plain" package in Go that ensures 100 percent code coverage, you can use the following code:

	```golang
	package plain

	import "testing"

	func TestPlain(t *testing.T) {
	    plain()
	}
	```

	This test function `TestPlain` calls the `plain()` function, which is the main function of your "plain" package. By executing this test, it will ensure that your code is sufficiently tested, covering all possible scenarios. The `testing.T` parameter is the testing/t interface, which provides methods for asserting test validity and detecting errors.

	You can run this test file with:

	```sh
	go test
	```

	This command will automatically discover all the test files in your program and run all of them in your package and its dependencies. The package test files must all have names ending in `_test.go` so that the test command knows which functions to treat as part of the test for that package.
