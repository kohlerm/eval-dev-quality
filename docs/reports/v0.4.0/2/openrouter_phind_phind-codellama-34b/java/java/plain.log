2024/04/25 18:56:30 Evaluating model "openrouter/phind/phind-codellama-34b" using language "java" and repository "java/plain"
2024/04/25 18:56:30 Querying model "openrouter/phind/phind-codellama-34b" with:
	Given the following Java code file "src/main/java/com/eval/Plain.java" with package "com.eval", provide a test file for this code with JUnit 5 as a test framework.
	The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
	The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

	```java
	package com.eval;

	class Plain {
	    static void plain() {
	    }
	}
	```

	To increase code coverage, you can create a test class called `PlainTest.java` in a directory `src/test/java/com/eval/` with the following code:

	```java
	package com.eval;

	import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

	import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertDoesNotThrow;

	class PlainTest {
	    @Test
	    void testPlain() {
	        assertDoesNotThrow(() -> Plain.plain());
	    }
	}
	```

	This test class consists of a single test method `testPlain()`, which checks that calling the static method `plain()` of `Plain` class does not throw an exception. This will ensure 100% code coverage for the given class `Plain.java`.
