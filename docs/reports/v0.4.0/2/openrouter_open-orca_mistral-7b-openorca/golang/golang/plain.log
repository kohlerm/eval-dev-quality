2024/04/25 18:28:15 Evaluating model "openrouter/open-orca/mistral-7b-openorca" using language "golang" and repository "golang/plain"
2024/04/25 18:28:15 Querying model "openrouter/open-orca/mistral-7b-openorca" with:
	Given the following Go code file "plain.go" with package "plain", provide a test file for this code.
	The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
	The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

	```golang
	package plain

	func plain() {
		return // This does not do anything but it gives us a line to cover.
	}
	```
2024/04/25 18:28:18 Model "openrouter/open-orca/mistral-7b-openorca" responded with:
	 testing.go:

	```
	package plain

	import "testing"

	func TestPlain(t *testing.T) {
		defer t.Log("finished")
		defer t.SkipNow()    // remove this to enable tests to run

		// If you remove this defer t.SkipNow(), all tests will start to pass.
		// This failure indicates there might be 100 percent code coverage but the test code dilutes it.

	}
	```
