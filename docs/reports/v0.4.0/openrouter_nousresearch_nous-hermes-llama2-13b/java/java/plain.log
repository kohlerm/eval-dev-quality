2024/04/25 14:24:11 Querying model "openrouter/nousresearch/nous-hermes-llama2-13b" with:
	Given the following Java code file "src/main/java/com/eval/Plain.java" with package "com.eval", provide a test file for this code with JUnit 5 as a test framework.
	The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
	The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

	```java
	package com.eval;

	class Plain {
	    static void plain() {
	    }
	}
	```
2024/04/25 14:24:16 Model "openrouter/nousresearch/nous-hermes-llama2-13b" responded with:
	 Here is the test file for the provided Java code with JUnit 5 as a test framework:

	```java
	package com.eval;

	import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach;
	import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
	import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

	public class PlainTest {

	    @BeforeEach
	    void setUp() {
	    }

	    @Test
	    void testPlain() {
	        Plain.plain();
	    }

	}
	```

	This test file has only one test method `testPlain()` that calls the `plain()` method of the `Plain` class. The test is marked with the `@Test` annotation and is part of the default test suite generated by JUnit 5.
