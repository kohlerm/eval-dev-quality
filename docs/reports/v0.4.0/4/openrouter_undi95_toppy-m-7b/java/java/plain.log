2024/04/25 20:03:54 Evaluating model "openrouter/undi95/toppy-m-7b" using language "java" and repository "java/plain"
2024/04/25 20:03:54 Querying model "openrouter/undi95/toppy-m-7b" with:
	Given the following Java code file "src/main/java/com/eval/Plain.java" with package "com.eval", provide a test file for this code with JUnit 5 as a test framework.
	The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
	The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

	```java
	package com.eval;

	class Plain {
	    static void plain() {
	    }
	}
	```
2024/04/25 20:03:57 Model "openrouter/undi95/toppy-m-7b" responded with:
	```java
	package com.eval;

	import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
	import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertDoesNotThrow;

	class PlainTest {
	    
	    @Test
	    void testPlain() {
	        assertDoesNotThrow(() -> Plain.plain());
	    }
	}
	```

	There may be additional test methods based on the purpose of the `Plain` class, but this test should cover the empty method. To achieve 100% code coverage, you may need to add additional test methods covering any other methods in the same class.
