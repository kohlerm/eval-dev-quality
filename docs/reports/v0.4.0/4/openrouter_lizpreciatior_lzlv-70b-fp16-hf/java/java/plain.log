2024/04/25 19:49:49 Evaluating model "openrouter/lizpreciatior/lzlv-70b-fp16-hf" using language "java" and repository "java/plain"
2024/04/25 19:49:49 Querying model "openrouter/lizpreciatior/lzlv-70b-fp16-hf" with:
	Given the following Java code file "src/main/java/com/eval/Plain.java" with package "com.eval", provide a test file for this code with JUnit 5 as a test framework.
	The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
	The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

	```java
	package com.eval;

	class Plain {
	    static void plain() {
	    }
	}
	```
2024/04/25 19:49:58 Model "openrouter/lizpreciatior/lzlv-70b-fp16-hf" responded with:
	 To create a JUnit 5 test for the given Java code, first create a new Java file named "PlainTest.java" in the "src/test/java" folder. Then, add the following code to the new file:
	```java
	package com.eval;

	import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach;
	import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

	import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

	class PlainTest {

	    private Plain plain;

	    @BeforeEach
	    void setUp() {
	        plain = new Plain();
	    }

	    @Test
	    void plain() {
	        plain.plain();
	    }
	}
	```
	This test file creates a new instance of the `Plain` class in the `setUp()` method, which is run before each test. The `plain()` method is called in the `plain()` test, ensuring that all lines of the original code are executed and covered by the test.
