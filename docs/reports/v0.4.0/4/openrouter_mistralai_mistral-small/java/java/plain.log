2024/04/25 19:53:51 Evaluating model "openrouter/mistralai/mistral-small" using language "java" and repository "java/plain"
2024/04/25 19:53:51 Querying model "openrouter/mistralai/mistral-small" with:
	Given the following Java code file "src/main/java/com/eval/Plain.java" with package "com.eval", provide a test file for this code with JUnit 5 as a test framework.
	The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
	The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

	```java
	package com.eval;

	class Plain {
	    static void plain() {
	    }
	}
	```
2024/04/25 19:53:55 Model "openrouter/mistralai/mistral-small" responded with:
	Here is the JUnit 5 test file that should achieve 100% code coverage for the given Plain.java code:

	```java
	package com.eval;

	import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
	import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertDoesNotThrow;

	public class PlainTest {

	    @Test
	    public void testPlainMethod() {
	        assertDoesNotThrow(() -> Plain.plain());
	    }
	}
	```

	This test file contains a single test case `testPlainMethod` that tests the `plain` method of the `Plain` class. The `assertDoesNotThrow` method is used to ensure that the `plain` method does not throw any exceptions when it is called. This test case should achieve 100% code coverage for the `plain` method.
