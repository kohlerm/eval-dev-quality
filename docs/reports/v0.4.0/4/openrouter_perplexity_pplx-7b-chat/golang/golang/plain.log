2024/04/25 19:40:45 Querying model "openrouter/perplexity/pplx-7b-chat" with:
	Given the following Go code file "plain.go" with package "plain", provide a test file for this code.
	The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
	The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

	```golang
	package plain

	func plain() {
		return // This does not do anything but it gives us a line to cover.
	}
	```

	```go
	package plain

	import "testing"

	func TestPlain(t *testing.T) {
		t.Run("test plain", func(t *testing.T) {
			t.Run("func calls itself", func(t *testing.T) {
				t.Parallel()
			})
		})
