2024/04/25 19:33:25 Evaluating model "openrouter/databricks/dbrx-instruct" using language "golang" and repository "golang/plain"
2024/04/25 19:33:25 Querying model "openrouter/databricks/dbrx-instruct" with:
	Given the following Go code file "plain.go" with package "plain", provide a test file for this code.
	The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
	The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

	```golang
	package plain

	func plain() {
		return // This does not do anything but it gives us a line to cover.
	}
	```
2024/04/25 19:33:27 Model "openrouter/databricks/dbrx-instruct" responded with:
	```golang
	package plain

	import (
		"testing"
	)

	func TestPlain(t *testing.T) {
		plain()
		// Since the plain function does not have any logic, there is nothing to test.
		// However, we still need to call it in order to achieve 100% code coverage.
	}
	```
