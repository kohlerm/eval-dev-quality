2024/04/25 19:55:51 Querying model "openrouter/nousresearch/nous-hermes-2-mistral-7b-dpo" with:
	Given the following Java code file "src/main/java/com/eval/Plain.java" with package "com.eval", provide a test file for this code with JUnit 5 as a test framework.
	The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
	The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

	```java
	package com.eval;

	class Plain {
	    static void plain() {
	    }
	}
	```
2024/04/25 19:55:53 Model "openrouter/nousresearch/nous-hermes-2-mistral-7b-dpo" responded with:
	```java
	package com.eval;

	import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertDoesNotThrow;
	import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

	class PlainTest {
	  
	    @Test
	    private void testPlainMethod() {
	        // Since the plain() method does not throw any exception, we just have to check that it
	        // does not throw any exception.
	        // This test will pass 100% code coverage because the plain() method has no execution
	        // path.
	        assertDoesNotThrow(() -> Plain.plain());
	    }
	}
