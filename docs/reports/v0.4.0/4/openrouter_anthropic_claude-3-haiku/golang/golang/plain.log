2024/04/25 19:32:29 Evaluating model "openrouter/anthropic/claude-3-haiku" using language "golang" and repository "golang/plain"
2024/04/25 19:32:29 Querying model "openrouter/anthropic/claude-3-haiku" with:
	Given the following Go code file "plain.go" with package "plain", provide a test file for this code.
	The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
	The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

	```golang
	package plain

	func plain() {
		return // This does not do anything but it gives us a line to cover.
	}
	```
2024/04/25 19:32:32 Model "openrouter/anthropic/claude-3-haiku" responded with:
	Here's the test file for the `plain.go` code:

	```golang
	package plain

	import (
		"testing"
	)

	func TestPlain(t *testing.T) {
		plain()
	}
	```

	This test file covers the entire `plain()` function, which does not do anything but provides a line of code to cover. The `TestPlain` function simply calls the `plain()` function, ensuring that the function is executed and the line of code is covered.

	When you run the tests, you should get 100% code coverage for the `plain.go` file.
