2024/04/25 19:40:02 Querying model "openrouter/openai/gpt-4-vision-preview" with:
	Given the following Go code file "plain.go" with package "plain", provide a test file for this code.
	The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
	The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

	```golang
	package plain

	func plain() {
		return // This does not do anything but it gives us a line to cover.
	}
	```
2024/04/25 19:40:05 Model "openrouter/openai/gpt-4-vision-preview" responded with:
	```golang
	package plain

	import "testing"

	func TestPlain(t *testing.T) {
		// We're just calling the function to ensure 100% coverage,
		// since it does not do anything nor does it have any return value or parameters.
		plain()
	}
	```
