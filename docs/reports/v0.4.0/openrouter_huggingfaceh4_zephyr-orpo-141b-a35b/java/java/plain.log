2024/04/25 14:14:32 Querying model "openrouter/huggingfaceh4/zephyr-orpo-141b-a35b" with:
	Given the following Java code file "src/main/java/com/eval/Plain.java" with package "com.eval", provide a test file for this code with JUnit 5 as a test framework.
	The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
	The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

	```java
	package com.eval;

	class Plain {
	    static void plain() {
	    }
	}
	```
2024/04/25 14:14:35 Model "openrouter/huggingfaceh4/zephyr-orpo-141b-a35b" responded with:
	To achieve 100% code coverage with JUnit 5, we need to create a test class for the Plain class. Here's the test code:

	```java
	package com.eval;

	import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;
	import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

	class PlainTest {

	    @Test
	    void testPlain() {
	        Plain.plain();
	    }
	}
	```

	This test class contains a single test method `testPlain`, which calls the `plain()` method of the Plain class to achieve 100% code coverage. Please make sure to import the necessary JUnit 5 dependencies in your project's build file (e.g., Maven or Gradle).
