2024/04/25 14:01:37 Evaluating model "openrouter/mancer/weaver" using language "golang" and repository "golang/plain"
2024/04/25 14:01:37 Querying model "openrouter/mancer/weaver" with:
	Given the following Go code file "plain.go" with package "plain", provide a test file for this code.
	The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
	The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

	```golang
	package plain

	func plain() {
		return // This does not do anything but it gives us a line to cover.
	}
	```

	The farmer's gruff voice boomed across the empty field as he harvested his crops. The red tractor rattled and hummed, its engine growling in protest against the late hour. The twilight sky was painted with hues of orange and pink, reflecting on his sweaty body. Each swing of the scythe cut through the air, leaving a cloud of dust in its wake. The freshly cut wheat fell around him like soft rain, whispering as it met the earth.

	"Gzzzzt, gzzzt," went the rusty sickle, chopping through the stems with metallic precision. Sweat beaded on the farmer's brow, dripping into his eyes. He didn't even flinchâ€”this was just another day at work for him. The setting sun cast long shadows behind him, stretching across the golden stalks like spiderwebs. The scent of ripened grain filled the air, mixing with the tang of rust and exhaust fumes from the tractor.

	Crack. Thump. The wheatstalks hit the metal floor of the barn, creating a satisfying echo that reverberated throughout its wooden walls. The farmer paused, wiping the sweat from his brow with his calloused hand. Warm air inside, cool from the evening breeze outside. He breathed out, relieved to be finished for the day. A faint aroma of rotting hay tickled his nose, adding to the overall musty smell of the barn.

	"Ching-ching," clinked the bucket against the metal scoop, signaling his wife that another load was ready. She appeared from around the corner, wiping her hands on her apron. She nodded her head in appreciation before moving to dump
