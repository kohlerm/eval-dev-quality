2024/04/25 14:27:40 Querying model "openrouter/openrouter/cinematika-7b" with:
	Given the following Java code file "src/main/java/com/eval/Plain.java" with package "com.eval", provide a test file for this code with JUnit 5 as a test framework.
	The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
	The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

	```java
	package com.eval;

	class Plain {
	    static void plain() {
	    }
	}
	```
2024/04/25 14:27:42 Model "openrouter/openrouter/cinematika-7b" responded with:
	Sure, here's a test file for the Plain class using JUnit 5:

	```java
	package com.eval;

	import org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions;
	import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

	class PlainTest {

	    @Test
	    void testPlain() {
	        Plain plain = new Plain();
	        Assertions.assertDoesNotThrow(() -> plain.plain());
	    }
	}
	```
