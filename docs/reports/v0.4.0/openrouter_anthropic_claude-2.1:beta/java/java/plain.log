2024/04/25 14:09:45 Querying model "openrouter/anthropic/claude-2.1:beta" with:
	Given the following Java code file "src/main/java/com/eval/Plain.java" with package "com.eval", provide a test file for this code with JUnit 5 as a test framework.
	The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
	The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

	```java
	package com.eval;

	class Plain {
	    static void plain() {
	    }
	}
	```

	Here is the JUnit 5 test file that provides 100% code coverage for the Plain.java file:

	```java
	package com.eval;

	import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

	import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertDoesNotThrow;

	class PlainTest {

	    @Test
	    void testPlain() {
	        assertDoesNotThrow(() -> {
	            Plain.plain();
	        });
	    }
	}
