2024/04/25 20:09:18 Evaluating model "openrouter/openchat/openchat-7b" using language "java" and repository "java/plain"
2024/04/25 20:09:18 Querying model "openrouter/openchat/openchat-7b" with:
	Given the following Java code file "src/main/java/com/eval/Plain.java" with package "com.eval", provide a test file for this code with JUnit 5 as a test framework.
	The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
	The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

	```java
	package com.eval;

	class Plain {
	    static void plain() {
	    }
	}
	```
2024/04/25 20:09:23 Model "openrouter/openchat/openchat-7b" responded with:
	 Below is the JUnit 5 test file for the given `com.eval.Plain` class.

	```java
	package com.eval;

	import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

	import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

	class PlainTest {
	    
	    @Test
	    void testPlain() {
	        Plain.plain();
	        assertTrue(true);
	    }
	}
	```

	This test file should compile and produce 100% code coverage for the `com.eval.Plain` class. The test method `testPlain` invokes the `plain()` method from the `Plain` class to satisfy code coverage requirements. The `assertTrue(true)` is redundant and does not actually test for anything meaningful, but since the `plain()` method does nothing, it will always evaluate to `true`.
