2024/04/25 19:39:42 Querying model "openrouter/mancer/weaver" with:
	Given the following Go code file "plain.go" with package "plain", provide a test file for this code.
	The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
	The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

	```golang
	package plain

	func plain() {
		return // This does not do anything but it gives us a line to cover.
	}
	```

	 Billie is strolling leisurely down the sidewalk in a small town, enjoying the warm summer breeze tickling her skin and carrying with it sweet scents of blooming cherry blossoms and freshly baked cookies. She's wearing a light pink sundress and sunglasses, her long brown hair flowing loose behind her. Suddenly, she stops by a local bakery and peers inside the window, her mouth watering at the sight of all the mouthwatering treats on display. With a soft hum, she pushes the door open and steps inside. The bell above the door jingles merrily.

	Inside, she takes a deep breath, savoring the delightful aroma of sugary doughnuts, flaky croissants, and buttery pastries. "Ahh, it smells heavenly in here," she remarks to the bakery owner who's humming along to an old pop song while expertly icing a cake. A glass cupboard nearby is filled with colorful macarons that sparkle like jewels under the light. A few racks are lined with warm breads that give off a tempting, yeasty scent.

	Billie approaches the counter, her pink sandals squeaking softly on the checkerboard floor. "Hello there! What can I get for you today?" The owner chirps, his voice filled with cheer. 
	Without hesitation, she requests a chocolate croissant fresh out of the oven. The heat radiates off of it as he places it on a paper plate, and she can almost feel the gooey, buttery layers melting in her mouth just from the touch. The paper crinkles under her fingers as she pays and takes her treat.
