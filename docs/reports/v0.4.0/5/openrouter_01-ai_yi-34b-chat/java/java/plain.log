2024/04/25 19:51:28 Evaluating model "openrouter/01-ai/yi-34b-chat" using language "java" and repository "java/plain"
2024/04/25 19:51:28 Querying model "openrouter/01-ai/yi-34b-chat" with:
	Given the following Java code file "src/main/java/com/eval/Plain.java" with package "com.eval", provide a test file for this code with JUnit 5 as a test framework.
	The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
	The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

	```java
	package com.eval;

	class Plain {
	    static void plain() {
	    }
	}
	```
2024/04/25 19:51:31 Model "openrouter/01-ai/yi-34b-chat" responded with:
	```java
	package com.eval;

	import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

	class PlainTest {

	    @Test
	    void testPlain() {
	        Plain.plain();
	    }

	}
	```

	This test file ensures that the `plain()` method in the `Plain` class is called, which results in 100% code coverage for the provided `Plain.java` code.
