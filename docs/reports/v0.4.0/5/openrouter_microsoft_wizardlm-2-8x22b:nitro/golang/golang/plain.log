2024/04/25 19:40:43 Evaluating model "openrouter/microsoft/wizardlm-2-8x22b:nitro" using language "golang" and repository "golang/plain"
2024/04/25 19:40:43 Querying model "openrouter/microsoft/wizardlm-2-8x22b:nitro" with:
	Given the following Go code file "plain.go" with package "plain", provide a test file for this code.
	The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
	The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

	```golang
	package plain

	func plain() {
		return // This does not do anything but it gives us a line to cover.
	}
	```
2024/04/25 19:40:51 Model "openrouter/microsoft/wizardlm-2-8x22b:nitro" responded with:
	Here is a test file for the `plain.go` file that should provide 100% code coverage:

	```go
	package plain

	import (
		"testing"
	)

	func TestPlain(t *testing.T) {
		// Call the plain function which should return immediately.
		// There is no return value or behavior to assert,
		// so we only need to call the function to cover the line.
		plain()
	}
	```

	To run the tests and check for code coverage, you can use the following commands:

	```sh
	go test -cover
	```

	This will compile and run the tests and then display the code coverage percentage. Since the `plain` function is trivial and the test calls the only function available, this should result in 100% coverage.
