2024/04/25 19:46:35 Querying model "openrouter/perplexity/sonar-medium-chat" with:
	Given the following Go code file "plain.go" with package "plain", provide a test file for this code.
	The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
	The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

	```golang
	package plain

	func plain() {
		return // This does not do anything but it gives us a line to cover.
	}
	```

	Here is a test file that should achieve 100% code coverage for the given Go code:

	```go
	package plain

	import "testing"

	func TestPlain(t *testing.T) {
		plain() // This tests the plain function.
	}

	func TestMain(m *testing.M) {
		m.Run() // This runs all tests in the current package.
	}
	```
