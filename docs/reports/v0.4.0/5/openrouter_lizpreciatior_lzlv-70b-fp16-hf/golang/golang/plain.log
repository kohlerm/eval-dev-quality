2024/04/25 19:37:54 Evaluating model "openrouter/lizpreciatior/lzlv-70b-fp16-hf" using language "golang" and repository "golang/plain"
2024/04/25 19:37:54 Querying model "openrouter/lizpreciatior/lzlv-70b-fp16-hf" with:
	Given the following Go code file "plain.go" with package "plain", provide a test file for this code.
	The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
	The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

	```golang
	package plain

	func plain() {
		return // This does not do anything but it gives us a line to cover.
	}
	```
2024/04/25 19:38:01 Model "openrouter/lizpreciatior/lzlv-70b-fp16-hf" responded with:
	 Here is a test file for the provided Go code that achieves 100% code coverage:

	```golang
	// plain_test.go
	package plain

	import (
		"testing"
	)

	func TestPlain(t *testing.T) {
		plain() // This call covers the function in plain.go.
	}
	```

	This test file contains a single test function, `TestPlain`, which calls the `plain()` function. When run, this test will cover all the lines in the original code, resulting in 100% code coverage.
