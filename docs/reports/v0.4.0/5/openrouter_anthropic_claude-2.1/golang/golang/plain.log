2024/04/25 19:33:15 Evaluating model "openrouter/anthropic/claude-2.1" using language "golang" and repository "golang/plain"
2024/04/25 19:33:15 Querying model "openrouter/anthropic/claude-2.1" with:
	Given the following Go code file "plain.go" with package "plain", provide a test file for this code.
	The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
	The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

	```golang
	package plain

	func plain() {
		return // This does not do anything but it gives us a line to cover.
	}
	```
2024/04/25 19:33:19 Model "openrouter/anthropic/claude-2.1" responded with:
	Here is the test code to get 100% coverage for the plain.go file:

	```go
	package plain

	import "testing"

	func TestPlain(t *testing.T) {
	    plain()
	}
	```

	This test file imports the plain package, declares a TestPlain test function that calls the plain() function, and runs that test with the testing framework. This will execute the plain() function, hitting the lone reachable line of code and achieving 100% code coverage.
