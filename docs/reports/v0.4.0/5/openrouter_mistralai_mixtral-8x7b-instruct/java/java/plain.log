2024/04/25 20:03:39 Evaluating model "openrouter/mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct" using language "java" and repository "java/plain"
2024/04/25 20:03:39 Querying model "openrouter/mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct" with:
	Given the following Java code file "src/main/java/com/eval/Plain.java" with package "com.eval", provide a test file for this code with JUnit 5 as a test framework.
	The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
	The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

	```java
	package com.eval;

	class Plain {
	    static void plain() {
	    }
	}
	```
2024/04/25 20:03:43 Model "openrouter/mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct" responded with:
	 Here is a test file for the given code using JUnit 5:

	```java
	package com.eval;

	import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
	import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

	class PlainTest {

	    @Test
	    void testPlain() {
	        Plain.plain();
	    }
	}
	```

	This test case only covers the method `plain()` which is a `void` method with no parameters, therefore, it cannot be tested with any return value or parameters. The test method `testPlain()` only checks if the `plain()` method is executed without any exception. This should provide 100% code coverage for the given code.
