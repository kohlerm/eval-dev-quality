2024/04/25 19:41:53 Querying model "openrouter/mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct" with:
	Given the following Go code file "plain.go" with package "plain", provide a test file for this code.
	The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
	The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

	```golang
	package plain

	func plain() {
		return // This does not do anything but it gives us a line to cover.
	}
	```
2024/04/25 19:41:55 Model "openrouter/mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct" responded with:
	 ```golang
	package plain

	import (
		"testing"
	)

	func TestPlain(t *testing.T) {
		// This test function will cover the line in the plain function.
		plain()
	}

	func TestMain(m *testing.M) {
		// Calling the actual test function
		m.Run()
		// The coverage of this file will be 100% after running the TestMain function.
	}
	```
