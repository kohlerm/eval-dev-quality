2024/04/25 19:36:12 Evaluating model "openrouter/gryphe/mythomax-l2-13b" using language "golang" and repository "golang/plain"
2024/04/25 19:36:12 Querying model "openrouter/gryphe/mythomax-l2-13b" with:
	Given the following Go code file "plain.go" with package "plain", provide a test file for this code.
	The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
	The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

	```golang
	package plain

	func plain() {
		return // This does not do anything but it gives us a line to cover.
	}
	```
2024/04/25 19:36:16 Model "openrouter/gryphe/mythomax-l2-13b" responded with:
	 // Test file for the "plain" package
	package plain

	import (
		"testing"
	)

	func TestPlain(t *testing.T) {
		plain()
		if _, err := fetchData(); err != nil {
			t.Errorf("Expected no error, got %v", err)
			return
		}
	}

	func fetchData() ([]byte, error) {
		// Simulate an asynchronous fetch
		return []byte("{}"), nil
	}
	```
