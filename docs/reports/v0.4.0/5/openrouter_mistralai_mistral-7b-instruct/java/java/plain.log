2024/04/25 20:01:52 Evaluating model "openrouter/mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct" using language "java" and repository "java/plain"
2024/04/25 20:01:52 Querying model "openrouter/mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct" with:
	Given the following Java code file "src/main/java/com/eval/Plain.java" with package "com.eval", provide a test file for this code with JUnit 5 as a test framework.
	The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
	The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

	```java
	package com.eval;

	class Plain {
	    static void plain() {
	    }
	}
	```
2024/04/25 20:01:54 Model "openrouter/mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct" responded with:
	 Here's a simple JUnit 5 test file for the given Plain class with 100% code coverage:

	```java
	package com.eval;

	import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
	import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertDoesNotThrow;

	class PlainTest {
	    @Test
	    void testPlainMethod() {
	        assertDoesNotThrow(() -> Plain.plain());
	    }
	}
	```

	This test checks that the plain() method does not throw any exception when called. Since the method is static, we use the `assertDoesNotThrow` method from JUnit 5 to accomplish this.
