2024/04/25 20:01:23 Evaluating model "openrouter/microsoft/wizardlm-2-8x22b" using language "java" and repository "java/plain"
2024/04/25 20:01:23 Querying model "openrouter/microsoft/wizardlm-2-8x22b" with:
	Given the following Java code file "src/main/java/com/eval/Plain.java" with package "com.eval", provide a test file for this code with JUnit 5 as a test framework.
	The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
	The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

	```java
	package com.eval;

	class Plain {
	    static void plain() {
	    }
	}
	```
2024/04/25 20:01:33 Model "openrouter/microsoft/wizardlm-2-8x22b" responded with:
	 Below is the JUnit 5 test code for the `Plain` class that should provide 100% code coverage. The test class should be placed in a corresponding test directory, typically under `src/test/java/com/eval/PlainTest.java`.

	```java
	package com.eval;

	import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
	import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

	class PlainTest {

	    @Test
	    void testPlainMethod() {
	        // Call the static method 'plain' from the Plain class
	        Plain.plain();

	        // Since the method does not have any observable behavior,
	        // we can only confirm that it does not throw an exception.
	        assertTrue(true, "The static method 'plain' should execute without throwing an exception.");
	    }
	}
	```

	This test checks that the `plain` method can be called without causing an exception, which is the only behavior that can be tested given the current implementation of the `Plain` class. Since there are no parameters, return values, or side effects to check, this is a sufficient test to achieve 100% code coverage for the given `Plain` class.
