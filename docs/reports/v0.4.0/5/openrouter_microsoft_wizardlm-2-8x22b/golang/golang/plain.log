2024/04/25 19:40:34 Evaluating model "openrouter/microsoft/wizardlm-2-8x22b" using language "golang" and repository "golang/plain"
2024/04/25 19:40:34 Querying model "openrouter/microsoft/wizardlm-2-8x22b" with:
	Given the following Go code file "plain.go" with package "plain", provide a test file for this code.
	The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
	The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

	```golang
	package plain

	func plain() {
		return // This does not do anything but it gives us a line to cover.
	}
	```
2024/04/25 19:40:43 Model "openrouter/microsoft/wizardlm-2-8x22b" responded with:
	 Here is a test file named `plain_test.go` that should provide 100% code coverage for the `plain.go` file:

	```go
	package plain

	import (
		"testing"
	)

	func TestPlain(t *testing.T) {
		// Since the function does not have any output or side effects,
		// we can only test that it does not panic.
		defer func() {
			if r := recover(); r != nil {
				t.Errorf("plain() recovered from panic: %v", r)
			}
		}()

		plain()
	}
	```

	To run the tests and check for code coverage, use the following command:

	```sh
	go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./
	```

	After running the tests, you can check the coverage report with:

	```sh
	go tool cover -func=coverage.out
	```

	This should show that the `plain` function has been fully covered by the test.
