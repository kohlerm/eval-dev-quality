2024/04/25 14:02:46 Querying model "openrouter/mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct:free" with:
	Given the following Go code file "plain.go" with package "plain", provide a test file for this code.
	The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
	The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

	```golang
	package plain

	func plain() {
		return // This does not do anything but it gives us a line to cover.
	}
	```
2024/04/25 14:02:48 Model "openrouter/mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct:free" responded with:
	 ```go
	package plain

	import (
		"testing"
	)

	func TestPlain(t *testing.T) {
		plain() // This line is intentionally left blank. It should be executed and therefore be covered by the test.
	}
	```
