2024/04/25 19:11:24 Evaluating model "openrouter/openai/gpt-4" using language "golang" and repository "golang/plain"
2024/04/25 19:11:24 Querying model "openrouter/openai/gpt-4" with:
	Given the following Go code file "plain.go" with package "plain", provide a test file for this code.
	The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
	The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

	```golang
	package plain

	func plain() {
		return // This does not do anything but it gives us a line to cover.
	}
	```
2024/04/25 19:11:32 Model "openrouter/openai/gpt-4" responded with:
	Here's a test file "plain_test.go" that would produce 100% code coverage for the package file above:

	```golang
	package plain

	import "testing"

	func TestPlain(t *testing.T) {
		// This function does nothing, so there is no output or error to check.
		plain()
	}
	```
	Although function `plain` does nothing, calling it in the test ensures it is covered.
