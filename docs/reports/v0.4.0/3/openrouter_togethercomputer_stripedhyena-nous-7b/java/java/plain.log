2024/04/25 19:37:29 Evaluating model "openrouter/togethercomputer/stripedhyena-nous-7b" using language "java" and repository "java/plain"
2024/04/25 19:37:29 Querying model "openrouter/togethercomputer/stripedhyena-nous-7b" with:
	Given the following Java code file "src/main/java/com/eval/Plain.java" with package "com.eval", provide a test file for this code with JUnit 5 as a test framework.
	The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
	The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

	```java
	package com.eval;

	class Plain {
	    static void plain() {
	    }
	}
	```
2024/04/25 19:37:32 Model "openrouter/togethercomputer/stripedhyena-nous-7b" responded with:
	Sure, here is a sample JUnit 5 test file for the given Java code:

	```java
	package com.eval;

	import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
	import org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions;
	import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

	class PlainTest {
	    @Test
	    public void testPlain() {
	        assertDoesNotThrow(() -> com.eval.Plain.plain());
	    }
	}
	```

	In this test file, we've used the `@Test` annotation to mark the test method. We've also imported the necessary JUnit classes. The `assertDoesNotThrow` method checks if the code being tested doesn't throw an exception. In this case, we're testing the `plain` method in the `Plain` class. The method doesn't perform any operations, so we expect it to complete without throwing any exceptions. This ensures that the `plain` method is functioning as expected.
