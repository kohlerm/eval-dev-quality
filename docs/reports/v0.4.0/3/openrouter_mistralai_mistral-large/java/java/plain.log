2024/04/25 19:27:40 Evaluating model "openrouter/mistralai/mistral-large" using language "java" and repository "java/plain"
2024/04/25 19:27:40 Querying model "openrouter/mistralai/mistral-large" with:
	Given the following Java code file "src/main/java/com/eval/Plain.java" with package "com.eval", provide a test file for this code with JUnit 5 as a test framework.
	The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
	The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

	```java
	package com.eval;

	class Plain {
	    static void plain() {
	    }
	}
	```
2024/04/25 19:27:46 Model "openrouter/mistralai/mistral-large" responded with:
	Sure, here is a simple JUnit 5 test class for your `Plain` class. This test class will provide 100% code coverage for the given code.

	```java
	package com.eval;

	import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

	public class PlainTest {

	    @Test
	    void testPlainMethod() {
	        Plain.plain();
	    }
	}
	```

	This test class contains a single test method `testPlainMethod` that calls the static `plain` method from the `Plain` class. Since the `plain` method doesn't have any logic inside, we just call it to ensure it's covered by the tests.
