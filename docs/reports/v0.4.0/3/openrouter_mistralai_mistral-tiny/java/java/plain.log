2024/04/25 19:28:17 Evaluating model "openrouter/mistralai/mistral-tiny" using language "java" and repository "java/plain"
2024/04/25 19:28:17 Querying model "openrouter/mistralai/mistral-tiny" with:
	Given the following Java code file "src/main/java/com/eval/Plain.java" with package "com.eval", provide a test file for this code with JUnit 5 as a test framework.
	The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
	The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

	```java
	package com.eval;

	class Plain {
	    static void plain() {
	    }
	}
	```
2024/04/25 19:28:22 Model "openrouter/mistralai/mistral-tiny" responded with:
	Here's an example of a JUnit 5 test file for the given `Plain.java` code. This test file covers the static `plain()` method.

	```java
	package com.eval;

	import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
	import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertDoesNotThrow;

	class PlainTest {

	    @Test
	    public void testPlainMethod() {
	        assertDoesNotThrow(() -> Plain.plain());
	    }
	}
	```

	This test file contains a single test `testPlainMethod()` that checks the `plain()` method doesn't throw any exception when called. The `assertDoesNotThrow` method is used to assert the execution of the given lambda expression (in this case, `Plain.plain()`) does not throw an exception.
