2024/04/25 19:10:09 Evaluating model "openrouter/mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct:nitro" using language "golang" and repository "golang/plain"
2024/04/25 19:10:09 Querying model "openrouter/mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct:nitro" with:
	Given the following Go code file "plain.go" with package "plain", provide a test file for this code.
	The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
	The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

	```golang
	package plain

	func plain() {
		return // This does not do anything but it gives us a line to cover.
	}
	```
2024/04/25 19:10:12 Model "openrouter/mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct:nitro" responded with:
	 Here is a test file that should provide 100% code coverage for the given "plain.go" file:

	```go
	package plain

	import (
		"testing"
	)

	func TestPlain(t *testing.T) {
		// Call the plain function and check that there are no enhancing side effects.
		plain()
	}

	func TestPlainCoverage(t *testing.T) {
		// This test function is only to increase coverage.
		for i := 0; i < 1000; i++ {
			plain()
		}
	}
	```

	This test file contains two test functions. The first one (`TestPlain`) tests that there are no enhancing side effects by simply calling the `plain` function. The second test function (`TestPlainCoverage`) is added to guarantee full coverage by calling the `plain` function multiple times.
