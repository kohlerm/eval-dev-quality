2024/04/25 19:29:36 Querying model "openrouter/mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct:nitro" with:
	Given the following Java code file "src/main/java/com/eval/Plain.java" with package "com.eval", provide a test file for this code with JUnit 5 as a test framework.
	The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
	The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

	```java
	package com.eval;

	class Plain {
	    static void plain() {
	    }
	}
	```
2024/04/25 19:29:38 Model "openrouter/mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct:nitro" responded with:
	 Here's a test file for the provided Java code using JUnit 5 as a test framework:

	```java
	package com.eval;

	import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
	import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

	class PlainTest {

	    @Test
	    void testPlain() {
	        Plain.plain();
	        // Add any additional assertions if needed
	    }
	}
	```

	This test file contains a single test case `testPlain()` that tests the `plain()` method of the `Plain` class. The test method simply calls the `plain()` method and does not perform any additional assertions since the method does not return a value or modify any state. You can add any additional assertions as needed to achieve 100% code coverage.
