2024/04/25 19:05:39 Evaluating model "openrouter/databricks/dbrx-instruct" using language "golang" and repository "golang/plain"
2024/04/25 19:05:39 Querying model "openrouter/databricks/dbrx-instruct" with:
	Given the following Go code file "plain.go" with package "plain", provide a test file for this code.
	The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
	The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

	```golang
	package plain

	func plain() {
		return // This does not do anything but it gives us a line to cover.
	}
	```
2024/04/25 19:05:41 Model "openrouter/databricks/dbrx-instruct" responded with:
	```golang
	package plain

	import (
		"testing"
	)

	func TestPlain(t *testing.T) {
		// We cannot test the functionality of the plain function as it does not do anything.
		// However we can still test that the function exists and can be called without causing a runtime error.
		plain()
	}
	```
