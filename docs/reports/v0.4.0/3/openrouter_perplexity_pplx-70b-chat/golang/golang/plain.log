2024/04/25 19:12:21 Querying model "openrouter/perplexity/pplx-70b-chat" with:
	Given the following Go code file "plain.go" with package "plain", provide a test file for this code.
	The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
	The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

	```golang
	package plain

	func plain() {
		return // This does not do anything but it gives us a line to cover.
	}
	```
2024/04/25 19:12:25 Model "openrouter/perplexity/pplx-70b-chat" responded with:
	To achieve 100% code coverage for the `plain` package and its `plain()` function, here's a test file named "plain_test.go" that you can use:

	```golang
	package plain

	import (
		"testing"
	)

	func TestPlain(t *testing.T) {
		// Test the plain function
		plain()
	}
	```

	This simple test establishes that the `plain` function is called during testing, ensuring that the single line in the `plain()` function is executed and contributing to 100% code coverage.

	Remember to save this test file as "plain_test.go" in the same directory as the "plain.go" file, and run your test with `go test ./...` to verify that the coverage is correct.
