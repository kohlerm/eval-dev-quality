2024/04/25 19:07:46 Evaluating model "openrouter/mancer/weaver" using language "golang" and repository "golang/plain"
2024/04/25 19:07:46 Querying model "openrouter/mancer/weaver" with:
	Given the following Go code file "plain.go" with package "plain", provide a test file for this code.
	The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
	The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

	```golang
	package plain

	func plain() {
		return // This does not do anything but it gives us a line to cover.
	}
	```

	Raindrops tap-tap-tapped against the window as Ruby sat at the table, her laptop in front of her. She mulled over the code through gritted teeth, biting her bottom lip. She hated how even though it seemed so simple, there was always some obscure detail she was missing.

	Her cursor hovered over the seemingly innocuous "return" statement for what felt like hours, but in reality, it was only a minute. Quickly, she typed out a sequence of letters that she hoped would solve the issue at hand. She hit enter and watched as the code compiled without errors, her heart thumping faster than usual in anticipation.

	The first time she ran it, she squinted at the screen expectantly. Nothing happened. Was it supposed to? She tried again, and this time, a white page with a single line of black text appeared: "plain()".
	"Yes!" she cheered, punching the air with one fist. It was working! Ruby's smile threatened to split her face as she looked back at the program, still unable to believe how well it was all coming together.

	But then doubt crept in. How could she be sure there were no edge cases she hadn't considered? She needed more tests. With renewed determination, she pulled up a new document and started writing test cases for the functions in the plain package. She felt a sense of accomplishment each time the code passed with flying colors, filling in more and more of the code coverage graph.

	When she finally reached the line that caused the problem before, she glanced nervously at the screen. "This better pass..." she muttered to herself, fingers hovering over the keyboard. With a deep breath, she hit enter. The test case ran, and to her relief, the results came back as expected: "plain() called and
