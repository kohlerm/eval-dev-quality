2024/04/25 19:08:16 Evaluating model "openrouter/meta-llama/llama-2-70b-chat:nitro" using language "golang" and repository "golang/plain"
2024/04/25 19:08:16 Querying model "openrouter/meta-llama/llama-2-70b-chat:nitro" with:
	Given the following Go code file "plain.go" with package "plain", provide a test file for this code.
	The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
	The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

	```golang
	package plain

	func plain() {
		return // This does not do anything but it gives us a line to cover.
	}
	```
2024/04/25 19:08:18 Model "openrouter/meta-llama/llama-2-70b-chat:nitro" responded with:
	  Sure, here's a test file for the "plain" package:

	```
	package plain

	import "testing"

	func TestPlain(t *testing.T) {
		plain()
	}
	```

	This test file imports the "testing" package and declares a single test function, "TestPlain". The test function calls the "plain" function, which does nothing, but its execution covers the line where it's defined.

	With this test file, the code coverage of the "plain" package will be 100%.
