2024/04/25 19:35:11 Evaluating model "openrouter/perplexity/pplx-7b-online" using language "java" and repository "java/plain"
2024/04/25 19:35:11 Querying model "openrouter/perplexity/pplx-7b-online" with:
	Given the following Java code file "src/main/java/com/eval/Plain.java" with package "com.eval", provide a test file for this code with JUnit 5 as a test framework.
	The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
	The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

	```java
	package com.eval;

	class Plain {
	    static void plain() {
	    }
	}
	```

	Unlike the Literate programming site or pages like cpearstaff.com, LiterateJava requires the package declaration to be at the beginning of each literal expressions rather than grouped at the top of each subroutine. In your case, the given class "Plain" is located in the package "com.eval", which ends with a semi-colon, and you need to specify the full path for importing it. For this purpose, you should declare the package on the first line of the code. The JUnit test code should be written in a separate new class. Here is an example of a valid JUnit test class:

	```java
	package com.eval;

	import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;
	import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

	class PlainTest {
	  Plain unit = new Plain();

	  @Test
	  public void plain_test() {
	    assertNotNull(unit);
	  }
	}
	```

	This class demonstrates how to import the package and create test cases for the `Plain.java` class using the JUnit 5 Test framework. Note that the `Plain.java` class must also be compiled in this example.
