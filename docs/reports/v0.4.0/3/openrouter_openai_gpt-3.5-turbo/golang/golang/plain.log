2024/04/25 19:11:09 Querying model "openrouter/openai/gpt-3.5-turbo" with:
	Given the following Go code file "plain.go" with package "plain", provide a test file for this code.
	The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
	The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

	```golang
	package plain

	func plain() {
		return // This does not do anything but it gives us a line to cover.
	}
	```
2024/04/25 19:11:12 Model "openrouter/openai/gpt-3.5-turbo" responded with:
	```golang
	package plain

	import "testing"

	func TestPlain(t *testing.T) {
		tests := []struct {
			name string
		}{
			{name: "Test 1"},
			{name: "Test 2"},
			{name: "Test 3"},
		}

		for _, tt := range tests {
			t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
				plain()
			})
		}
	}
