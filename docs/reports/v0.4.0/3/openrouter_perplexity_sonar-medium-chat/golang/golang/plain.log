2024/04/25 19:12:41 Evaluating model "openrouter/perplexity/sonar-medium-chat" using language "golang" and repository "golang/plain"
2024/04/25 19:12:41 Querying model "openrouter/perplexity/sonar-medium-chat" with:
	Given the following Go code file "plain.go" with package "plain", provide a test file for this code.
	The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
	The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

	```golang
	package plain

	func plain() {
		return // This does not do anything but it gives us a line to cover.
	}
	```
2024/04/25 19:12:45 Model "openrouter/perplexity/sonar-medium-chat" responded with:
	Here is the test file that should achieve 100% code coverage for the provided Go code:

	```go
	package plain

	import "testing"

	func TestPlain(t *testing.T) {
		plain() // This calls the function we want to test.
	}

	func TestMain(m *testing.M) {
		// This is a special function that is executed before any tests run.
		// We don't need to do anything in this case, so we just call m.Run() to run the tests.
		m.Run()
	}
	```

	This test file includes a test function `TestPlain` that calls the `plain` function. This will ensure that the line in the `plain` function is executed, achieving 100% code coverage. The `TestMain` function is a special function that is executed before any tests run. In this case, we don't need to do anything special, so we just call `m.Run()` to run the tests.
