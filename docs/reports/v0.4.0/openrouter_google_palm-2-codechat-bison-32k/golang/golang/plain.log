2024/04/25 13:57:25 Querying model "openrouter/google/palm-2-codechat-bison-32k" with:
	Given the following Go code file "plain.go" with package "plain", provide a test file for this code.
	The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
	The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

	```golang
	package plain

	func plain() {
		return // This does not do anything but it gives us a line to cover.
	}
	```

	 ```golang
	package plain

	import (
		"testing"
	)

	func TestPlain(t *testing.T) {
		plain() // Test that the plain function runs without panicking.
	}
	```
